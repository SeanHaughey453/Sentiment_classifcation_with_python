Provided all of the files are in the same folder the code should have no issues(well depends on whos running it...)

my yelp review dataset was too large to uploaded and its handy downloaded from yelp.

best_performing_algorithim.py is my best performing model. 
the basic_cnn_model.py is the work for my best cnn_model the second best model i created
kfold_validation_lstm.py is my kfold validation script
kfold_validation_output.txt is the output from running the above. i then added the average between the 5 seperate fold metrics.
