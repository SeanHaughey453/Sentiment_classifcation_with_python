Provided all of the files are in the same folder the code should have no issues running if you require my venv to run i have this attached aswell

my yelp review dataset was too large to upload to blackboard so it had to be removed.

best_performing_algorithim.py is my best performing model. 
the basic_cnn_model.py is the work for my best cnn_model the second best model i created
kfold_validation_lstm.py is my kfold validation script
kfold_validation_output.txt is the output from running the above. i then added the average between the 5 seperate fold metrics.



to access the venv run the activate script in the root folder(my venv had to be removed aswell just like the yelp datset review as they were making the file too big to upload to blackboard)

venv\Scripts\activate
